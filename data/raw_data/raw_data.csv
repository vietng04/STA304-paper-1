*: trials can be done for protecting bicycle lanes, pedestrian paths and reserved lanes 
*: This looks interesting - do you have costing info?  Trellis Transit requires pedestrian notifications in events where there is no formal 'Stop' so that a lowering Pod doesn't surprise anyone - one way we do this is by lowering over gardens - but in downtown areas, we lower to sidewalks (for accessibility) and need bright notifications such as this.
